Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some arrive on a
small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per
week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate
small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of
expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
island within the next few years. <br> <br>

Taniti City is flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area
surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
